        <p class="lead">Becoming a programmer from a non-tech background is no easy feat. We’re not offering get-into-tech-quick miracles and it takes a least a year of intense studies in a preferred programming language using open course platforms like Coursera to attain hire-able tech skills. As a result, we only accept individuals who have completed coding bootcamps and need help restructuring their resume for entry level roles as well as individuals who seek to advance in their tech careers and need help interviewing for mid-level and senior positions. We offer the following tech coaching: resume reviews, technical coding mock interviews as well as templates and resources for getting hired for a competitive and well-paying role as a data analyst, data engineer or a cyber security analyst.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">About</h2>
        <p class="lead" p style="padding: 30px">We have high success rates in helping our users attain academic and career accomplishments because we screen each individual who uses our platform and apply expertise from our founder completing a Master of Science in Analytics (Data Science) from the University of Chicago and achieving upward career mobility from starting off as an Administrative Assistant. Working at the Admissions Office at Carnegie Mellon University and applying for scholarships while earning my undergraduate degrees at the University of Pittsburgh is how I acquired the editing expertise to successfully market application materials for acceptance. I also successfully navigated into the technology industry (with upward mobility from an Analyst to a Data Systems Engineer) after completing my advance degree. The process of getting admitted into a graduate program actually mirrors the job search in the sense that it involves submitting applications including resumes and follow up interviews. This is why we’ve scaled out to include academics as well as professionals in the following industries: data analytics, data engineering and cyber security. Outside of the tech space, we support aspiring academics get into their dream schools by editing their applications and resumes/cvs to streamline the acceptance process. Thus far, we have assisted professionals get into programs like an MBA at Columbia University in the city of New York, an MSc in Geographical Information Management at Cranfield University in the UK as well as a PhD in Land Surveying at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. <br> Three of our initial aspirants have graduated from their Masters programs from the following universities: New York University, University of Michigan and Columbia University. Aspiring applicants have gone on to become successful in their tech careers working in management and in technical senior roles at companies like Nvidia and MongoDb.</p>
