          <p class="lead">In technology a video interview is where a member of a team requests an interview lasting 30 minutes to an hour. They’ll ask questions about programming languages including Azure, Python, T-SQL, AWS, R used in statistical analysis etc. This is where I’m helpful because I have resources including cybersecurity protocol interviewing answers. You apply with your resume to job boards and a recruiter follows up with an interview request.
          Before a video interview is a telephone screen lasting about 15 minutes where the recruiter asks you behavioral questions to have an idea of what programming languages you’ve used along with your working before.
